### Commands

The following sections describe the commands available in JFrog CLI when performing Release Lifecycle Management operations.

### Creating a Release Bundle from builds or from existing Release Bundles

This command creates a Release Bundle from a published build-info or from an existing Release Bundle.  
1. To create a Release Bundle from published build-infos, provide the `--builds` option, which accepts a path to a file using the following JSON format:
    ```json
    {
      "builds": [
        {
          "name": "build name",
          "number": "build number",
          "project": "project"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    `number` is optional (if left empty, the latest build will be used)
    
    `project` is optional (if left empty, the default project will be used)

2. To create a Release Bundle from existing Release Bundles, provide the `--release-bundles` option, which accepts a path to a file using the following JSON format:
    ```json
    {
      "releaseBundles": [
        {
          "name": "release bundle name",
          "version": "release bundle version",
          "project": "project"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    `project` is optional (if left empty, the default project will be used)

##### Example 1

Create a Release Bundle with the name "myApp" and version "1.0.0", with signing key pair "myKeyPair".

```
jf rbc --spec=/path/to/release-bundles-spec.json --signing-key=myKeyPair myApp 1.0.0
```
##### Example 3

Create a Release Bundle synchronously with the name "myApp" and version "1.0.0", in project "project0", with signing key pair "myKeyPair".
The Release Bundle will include the artifacts of the Release Bundles that were provided in the Release Bundles spec.
```
jf rbc --spec=/path/to/release-bundles-spec.json --signing-key=myKeyPair --sync=true --project=project0 myApp 1.0.0
```
### Promoting a Release Bundle

This commands promotes a Release Bundle to a target environment.
